### A New OBF Website

With the help of Deepashree Deshmukh, who was recruited via the [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) program, we have a fantastic new website! [Visit it now](https://www.open-bio.org/) or [read more on our blog](https://www.open-bio.org/2019/04/08/goodbye-mediawiki-hello-new-website/).


### OBF Travel Fellowships

The diversity-oriented [OBF travel fellowships](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) offer up to $1000 USD for conference travel and accommodation.

Applications are rolling, and the next application deadline is August 15th. If your event is before the 15th, never fear - it's also okay to apply for fellowships for events in the recent past. 

### BOSC 2019 

[BOSC 2019](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/) will take place in Basel, Switzerland, July 24-25, as part of ISMB/ECCB 2019. Preparations are well underway, with first-round abstracts all reviewed and notified (huge thanks to all out volunteer reviewers!).

- **Late-breaking applications are still open!** If you haven't submitted an abstract yet, you can still [submit a late-breaking abstract to BOSC until the end of the day on May 15th](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/).

### Community needs survey 

The OBF is constantly re-evaluating ways to help out the open science + life science community. We're open to interesting and creative suggestions of ways to help, whether technical resources, community resources, diversity related initiatives, or something else we haven't thought of yet. The survey only takes two minutes and is anonymous. Please also help us spread the word by sharing it with others. [Visit the OBF community needs survey](https://forms.gle/EVA6cE99cPX7yHPG6).

### Google Summer of Code

The OBF acts as an umbrella host organisation for open source organisations who wish to work with a student for the four months of [Google Summer of Code](https://obf.github.io/GSoC/). This year, five students have been selected, working on projects for BioJS, Sambamba, BioD, the Journal of Open Data Publications, and antiSMASH. [See more about the projects on the Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/?sp-search=open%20bio#5857327278718976).

## Interesting links
- Last year, one of our travel fellowship awardees, Anisha Keshevan,  [shared her impressions of the 2018 eLife Sprint](https://www.open-bio.org/2018/05/22/saving-science-from-itself-2018-elife-innovation-sprint/). The sprint is on again this year! Emmy Tsang, Innovation officer at eLife, shares the following: The **eLife Innovation Sprint** is taking place Sep 4–5 in Cambridge, UK. The #eLifeSprint is a two-day collaborative event where we bring together open-source developers, designers, researchers and other open science enthusiasts to drive forward scientific research communication through innovation. We would love to have the OBF community at the Sprint–-travel support is available for those from under-represented communities. [Find out more and apply here](http://sprint.elifesciences.org?utm_source=obf&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=Sprint-register), before Jun 2. 
- Are you an **ECR looking for funding?** [ECRCentral](https://ecrcentral.org/) is a centralised funding and travel grant database aimed at Early Career Researchers - incidentally, it is also a resource that was developed at the 2018 eLife Innovation Sprint! 
- Twitter is a great way to disseminate and share information. [Swapna Menon has been curating Twitter moments](https://twitter.com/SwapnaBioinfo/moments) that might interest people in biology, including collections on [Single cell omics](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1056042802029756416) and [Oxford Nanopore](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1059363496582799360).
