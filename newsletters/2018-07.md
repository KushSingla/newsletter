# OBF Newsletter July 2018

Hi everyone and welcome to the Open Bioinformatics Foundation Newsletter. At GCCBOSC this year we had a fantastic Birds of a Feather meeting discussing [ways to improve community year-round for the OBF](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/07/09/following-up-from-boscs-obf-birds-of-a-feather-meeting/). One of the ideas was to create a newsletter, with the aim of allowing community members to provide updates on the open bioinformatics related projects they're working on or aware of. Right now this is very experimental, so we'd welcome feedback of any kind.

## OBF news

### GCCBOSC
 If you couldn't make it this year (and maybe even if you could) you can read the official report, enjoy [the brilliant photos taken by Berenice Batut](https://www.flickr.com/photos/134305289@N03/sets/72157695693844792/), or [fill out the GCCBOSC feedback survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckB5ckoxvXf8UoheO9qOiGuWYsMRXWoOu_HkQ0RATzXmQZQA/viewform) - particularly if you _didn't_ attend!

### OBF logo redesign
 [Voting on the OBF's new logo is now open!](https://goo.gl/forms/9cR0aqYNBpIDZ14K2) Three volunteers have created drafts of what could soon be the new logo for the OBF. [Vote now](https://goo.gl/forms/9cR0aqYNBpIDZ14K2) to have your say - and special thanks to Sarah Thursby, Chuck McCallum, and Aleix Lafita for their design efforts!

## Community updates

### miRTop

Lorena Pantano [presented miRTop at GCCBOSC](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/EiuN/mirtop-an-open-source-community-project-for-the-development-of-a-unified-format-file-for-mirna-data) this year, and already has some great updates, including an [official page for the miRNA annotation format, ](https://github.com/miRTop/mirGFF3)a brand-new listing on [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/bsg-s001218/), and a [winner for their logo competition](https://github.com/miRTop/mirtop/issues/29)!

### What is a pathway, anyway?

Lluis Revalla is looking for feedback on a personal project that aims to help standardize what a pathway is, or at least to compare the different database definitions and see their implications further down on the enrichment analysis tools using them. [The GSEAdv package](http://github.com/llrs/GSEAdv) analyses the properties of pathways of any database and will be released in Bioconductor when finished.

## Future editions

### What format?

This is the first edition of this newsletter but we hope it won't be the last! We're still working out the details and have some questions we haven't ironed out yet. Should we accept content from any source, or only members and perhaps BOSC attendees or presenters? We don't want to overburden the newsletter curators. How often should the newsletter be? Monthly seems maybe too often - perhaps quarterly? If you have any thoughts we'd love to hear from you - or if you love writing and would like to help curate the newsletter, please let us know!

### Your content needed for the next issue!

If you have an exciting project update, request for feedback, or interesting link, [feel free to share it with us on GitHub](https://github.com/OBF/newsletter/issues/3), or discuss it offline if you're not sure whether or not your content is suitable - we're looking for content that's primarily open source / science related.
