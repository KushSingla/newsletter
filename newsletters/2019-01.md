### OBF redesigns
#### Logo
In the [first issue of our newsletter](https://github.com/OBF/newsletter/blob/master/newsletters/2018-07.md), we encouraged you to vote in the OBF logo redesign competition. The winning logo, designed by [Aleix Lafita](https://github.com/lafita), is shown above.

#### Website
During late 2018 and early 2019, our [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) intern [Deepashree Deshmukh](https://github.com/kushinauwu) will be redesigning the OBF website, with the goal of creating a unified community hub for the OBF. [More on our blog](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/11/19/updates-are-coming/).

### GCCBOSC 2018 Videos
Videos from GCCBOSC 2018 are now up! The BOSC videos can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir-OOQiOhXaHvCY_KYshsOMULuXDqvh7).

### OBF Travel Fellowships

The [OBF travel fellowships](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) offer up to $1000 USD for conference travel and accommodation. Awardees from the last round [Anisha Keshevan](https://github.com/akeshavan), [Tendai Mutangadura](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/08/29/the-color-of-bioinformatics/), and [Farah Zaib Khan](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/08/18/city-of-roses-they-call-it-portland-oregon-usa/) shared their experiences as fellowship recipients on the OBF blog. 

We're particularly keen to offer these fellowships to people from underrepresented groups, including applicants outside Europe and the USA - please share with friends and acquaintances. The next **deadline to [apply](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) is the 15th of April**. 

### BOSC 2019 will be in Basel, Switzerland with ISMB

After 2018's great success [combining BOSC with the Galaxy Community Conference](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/07/27/gccbosc-2018-post-meeting-report/), we're [hoping to alternate years](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/08/02/taking-turns/) between [ISMB](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019) and GCC. In 2019, [BOSC](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2019) will be held at ISMB in Basel, Switzerland on the 24th and 25th of July (with the Codefest the following days). 

### Google Summer of Code

The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a three-month paid internship opportunity for students around the globe to learn about contributing to open source. The OBF typically acts as an umbrella organisation, allowing member projects and affiliated projects to take on GSoC students. 

In 2018, students worked on projects for [BioJS, BioNode, CobraPy, NextFlow, and OpenMS](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/04/24/welcome-to-our-google-summer-of-code-2018-students/). 

If you have an open source project idea, consider mentoring as part of the OBF! It's a great two-way exchange - students get paid to get open source experience, while projects get three months of dedicated work. If you're interested, visit the [OBF GSoC site to learn more](https://obf.github.io/GSoC/) - project ideas are due in late January, so now's the time to start thinking!

## Community updates

- People who use NextFlow workflows might be interested in [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) - a curated set of high-quality re-usable analysis pipelines with good documentation.
- Do you edit common biological file formats like `fasta`, `sam`, or `pdb`? [BioSyntax](https://github.com/bioSyntax/bioSyntax) is an open source plugin that provides syntax highlighting for [multiple file formats](https://biosyntax.org/man#supported-file-formats) in vim, less, gedit, & sublime. 

### Galaxy Training CoFest

The Galaxy Training Network has developed an infrastructure to deliver interactive training based on Galaxy: one central place (https://training.galaxyproject.org) to aggregate training materials covering many current research topics. Each topic is supported by tutorials developed and maintained by the community via a GitHub repository: https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material.

To support the community and this project, the Galaxy Training Network is organizing regular online CoFests (Collaboration/Contribution Fests) once every 3 months on the 3rd Thursday for a day of the collaborative work on the training content. The last one was on the 15th of November and the next one will be on the **21st of February**. More information can found on [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/1152).
